# ToolPathVis
ToolPathVis is a tool from MakerBot Industries for visualization of a toolpath in 3 dimensions. While this was build for 3d printing, it is useful for a lot of technologies and topics.

To build this tool you will need to install QtCreator, and open the GCodeViewer.pro file as a QtCreator project.
